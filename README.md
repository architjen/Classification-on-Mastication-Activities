-- The project is about classifying the sound based on mastication sounds. 

-- Mastication sounds are sounds related to jaw movements (eg: eating, drinking, talking, chewing).

-- Why do we classify these sounds? Some health issues like Obesity has been linked by the mastication counts, which in effect 
causes lot other serious health conditions. So by keeping the counts of mastication, eating habits can be monitored.
